# **QUICK GUIDE IN SETTING REACT APP READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**
React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in creating software interface. React offers several tools that makes it standout and popular in today's software development industry. Therefore, it's a great feat to be a React developer. The purpose of this article is to provide a quick guide in setting up your React app ready for development. As a React developer, you also need to know exactly what React entails and its benefits.
## **What is React?**
React is a JavaScript library used in developing interactive and robust user interface. In other words, React is used to create frontend web applications. React can be used to develop **Single Page Applications (SPA)** using independent and reusable components, thereby increasing her readability and maintainability.

React was developed by Jordan Walke, a software Engineer at Meta. Jordan Walke first came up with a prototype known as FaxJS, which was deployed to Facebook News feed in 2011. On May 2013, React was officially launched and made an open-source at the JavaScript Conference in  US.

React have grew to include several features which serve as frameworks in developing complete websites. Some of these frameworks are Next.js, Gatsby, React Native, amongst others. React Native is a React framework used in developing mobile applications such as iOS and Andriod.
## **Benefits of React**
React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries. This is because React offers several and more advance benefits that makes her standout. Let's look at some of the benefits of React
* **React Components:** React apps are build using components. Components are independent and reusable piece of codes. They serve as JavaScript functions and return HTML. Using independent and reusable components increase the readability and maintainability of React codes. They also reduces the amount of codes to be written as they can be use in several parts of the applications.
* **Web Framework:**  Websites can be developed using React-powered frameworks maintained by various communities. Some of these frameworks includes Next.js maintained by Vercel, Gatsby maintained by Netlify, Remix maintained by Shopify, amongst others. These React-powered frameworks provide features for server-side rendering, data fetching, routing and so on.
* **Mobile Applications:** React can be used to create mobile applications using React Native. React Native is an open-source JavaScript Framework used to develop iOS and Andriod mobile applications.
* **Testing and Debugging:** React provides developers with tools to test and debug their codes and ensure effectiveness and efficiency of their software. One of such tool includes Jest, React Developer Tools, and so on. Developers can test their program to ensure they work correctly as expected.
* **Accuracy:** Just as every other programming languages and frameworks, React provides reliable and accurate foundation in building interactive websites.
## **Steps in setting up React Applications**
This section will guide you through the steps in setting up your React app ready for development. Lets' get started with the steps in creating your first React app.
## **Step 1 - Install Node.js**
You need to install Node.js for local development of your React app. To install Node, visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), click on the recommended downloads.
## **STEP 2 - Create Project folder**
 Create and navigate to your project folder using your terminal to build your React app.
 ```
 C:\Users\Usersname\Desktop>mkdir react_project
 C:\Users\Usersname\Desktop>cd react_project
 ```
## **STEP 3 - Create React App**
Create your new React app by typing the command below. Note that you must be at your folder directory.
```
C:\Users\Usersname\Desktop\react_project> npx create-react-app my-app
```
OR
```
C:\Users\Usersname\Desktop\react_project>npm init react-app my-app
```
For yarn users, runs:
```
C:\Users\Usersname\Desktop\react_project>yarn create-react-app my-app
```
The above codes takes a while to create your React app. Note that **my-app** is the name of your React app and it can be any name of your choice.
Choose any of the commands above to create a new React app and please do note that **my-app** can be any name of your choice.

The installation process takes a while and when completed, a folder named 'my-app' will be created and in it contains several folders and files such as src, node_modules, .gitignore, package, amongst others. Note that **my-app** is your app name and can be any name of your choice.
## **STEP 4 - Start server**
In your terminal, navigate to the app directory where package.json is located. The package.json file contains dependencies and scripts that gives you access to run React scripts commands such as start, build, test, etc. Start development server as seen in the codes below.
```
C:\Users\Usersname\Desktop\react_project\my-app>npm start
```
The above command start development server on your default browser. The development server is run on localhost:3000, with the image below displayed on your screen.
