# **QUICK GUIDE IN SETTING REACT APP READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**
React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in creating software interface. React offers several tools that makes it standout and popular in today's software development industry. Therefore, it's a great feat to be a React developer. If you are ready to start a career as a React developer, this guide will put you through as it explains what React is, benefits of React, and steps in setting up React app ready for development.
## **What is React?**
React is a JavaScript library used in developing interactive and robust user interface. In other words, React can be used to develop **Single Page Applications (SPA)** using independent and reusable components, thereby increasing her readability and maintainability.

React is founded and maintained by Facebook now known as Meta. React Native is used to build iOS and Andriod mobile applications.
## **Benefits of React**
React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries. This is because React offers several and more advance benefits compare to other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Let's look at some of the benefits of React
1. **Clean codes:** The structural pattern of React makes her codes easy to read, understand and maintain. For instance, React applications are developed using independent and reusable components which simplify its readabilty and maintainability.
2. **Fewer codes:** React components are reusable thereby reducing the amounts of codes to be written.
3. **Reusability:** React apps are built using reusable components. This means that React componenets can be use in various part of an application.
4. **Testing and Debugging:** React provides developers with tools to test and debug their codes and ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of software. One of such tool includes **unit test**. Developers can conduct unit test to ensure their program work correctly as expected.
5. **Accuracy:** Just as every programming languages and frameworks, React apps produces accurate outputs.
6. **Mobile Applications:** React can be used to develop iOS and andriod mobile applications using React Native.
## **Steps in setting up React Applications**
This section will guide you through the steps in setting up your React application ready for development.
### **Prerequisite:**
You need **Node Package Manager (NPM)** to install and create JavaScript libraries and frameworks. NPM is also used to manage dependencies. Therefore, Node.js is needed to be installed on your computer before proceeding as it comes with NPM. Visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to download Node.js.

Now let's get started with the steps in creating your first React app.
1. **STEP 1:** Create a folder where you want to create your React app. You can use your terminal by firstly, navigate to where you want to create the folder, and then type <mark style="padding:0 5px; background-color:grey; color:white; border-radius:2px">mkdir [folder-name]</mark>, where [folder-name] is what you choose to name your folder without the square bracket.
2. **STEP 2:** Navigate to your newly created folder by typing the command below.
```
cd folder-name
```
**Note** folder name is the name of your folder.

3. **STEP 3:** Create a react application by running the command below.
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
OR
```
npm init react-app my-app
```
For yarn users, runs:
```
yarn create-react-app my-app
```
Choose any of the commands above to create a new React app and please do note that **my-app** can be any name of your choice. The installation process takes a while and when completed, a folder name 'my-app' will be created and in it, contains several folders and files such as src, node_modules, .gitignore, package, amongst others.

4. **STEP 4:** Navigate to your React app using cd command in your terminal, and run the below command to start your React project.
```
npm start
```
The above command start development server and auto open your defualt browser. The development server is run on localhost server with port number 3000; the image below will be displayed on your screen.
